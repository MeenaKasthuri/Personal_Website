# Meena Kasthuri - Personal Website
This is my personal webpage. It shows my experience. The webpage has a full-screen background video and a clean design.

## Live Demo

You can see the website here:  
[https://MeenaKasthuri.github.io/Personal_Website/](https://MeenaKasthuri.github.io/Personal_Website/)

## Project Files

- `Meena_Website.html` - Main webpage file (same code from index.html file)
- `index.html` - Main webpage file  
- `background2.mp4` - Background video  
- `README.md` - This file

  ## How to Run Locally

1. Clone the repository:

        git clone https://github.com/MeenaKasthuri/Personal_Website.git

2. Go into the folder:
cd Personal_Website

3. Open index.html in a browser
Or open it in VS Code and use Live Server for better experience.

## Notes

Make sure index.html is named exactly like this for GitHub Pages.

Keep background2.mp4 in the same folder so the video works.
